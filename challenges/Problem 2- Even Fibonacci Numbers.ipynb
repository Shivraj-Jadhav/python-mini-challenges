    "The given code implements a function fiboEvenSum(n) that calculates the sum of even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to a given value n. Here's a breakdown of the code logic:\n",

    "<li>The function fiboEvenSum(n) takes an integer n as input.\n",
    "    </li><li>The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence, 1 and 2, are explicitly handled as base cases. If n is 1, the function returns 0 (no even terms), and if n is 2, the function returns 2 (only the second term is even).\n",
    "</li><li>For n greater than 2, the function initializes variables a and b to represent the first two terms of the sequence (1 and 2, respectively).\n",
    "</li><li>Variable c is initialized to 0 and will be used to store the current term being generated.\n",
    "</li><li>Variable ans is initialized to 2 since the second term (2) is even, and we've already accounted for it.\n",
    "</li><li>A loop is executed n+1 times, as we want to consider terms up to and including n.\n",
    "</li><li>Inside the loop, the current term c is calculated by adding the previous two terms a and b.\n",
    "</li><li>The values of a and b are then updated: a becomes the previous value of b, and b becomes the current value of c. This step effectively shifts the variables to calculate the next term.\n",
    "</li><li>If the current term c exceeds the given value n, the loop is terminated using the break statement.\n",
    "</li><li>If the current term c is even (divisible by 2), its value is added to ans.\n",
    "</li><li>After the loop completes, the final value of ans is returned as the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence up to n.</li>\n",
