Welcome to the Weekly Python Programs Repository! Here you will find a collection of mini Python programs, each accompanied by a problem statement and its solution. New programs will be added every week, so stay tuned for exciting challenges and solutions.

## Program Files

The repository is organized into different files, each corresponding to a specific problem statement. You can find the programs in the following files:

- `program1.py` - Problem Statement 1 and its Solution
- `program2.py` - Problem Statement 2 and its Solution
- `program3.py` - Problem Statement 3 and its Solution
- ...

Feel free to explore the files, review the problem statements, and examine the provided solutions. You can use these programs as learning resources or even contribute your own solutions!

## üöÄ How to Use
To use this repository, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
